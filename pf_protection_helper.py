PowerFactory application context managers and utilities.

This module provides context managers for managing PowerFactory application
state and utility functions used throughout the protection assessment
scripts.

Context Managers:
    app_manager: Manage PowerFactory application lifecycle
    project_manager: Create temporary library folders
    temporary_variation: Create and manage temporary network variations

Utility Functions:
    obtain_region: Determine network region from project path

Usage:
    from pf_protection_helper import app_manager, obtain_region

    with app_manager(app, gui=True) as app:
        region = obtain_region(app)
        # ... perform analysis ...

    Context manager for PowerFactory application lifecycle.

    Manages application state during script execution, handling output
    settings, GUI updates, caching, and cleanup on exit.

    Args:
        app: PowerFactory application instance.
        clear: If True, clear output window on entry. Default True.
        gui: If True, enable GUI updates during execution. Default False.
        echo_on: If True, enable full echo output. Default False.
        cache: If True, enable write cache. Default False.
            WARNING: Only use cache=True if you understand the impacts.

    Yields:
        The configured PowerFactory application instance.

    Side Effects:
        On entry:
            - Resets calculation state
            - Clears output window (if clear=True)
            - Configures echo settings
            - Sets GUI update and cache modes
            - Enables user break

        On exit:
            - Restores echo to full output
            - Re-enables GUI updates
            - Disables user break
            - Writes cached changes to database (if cache was enabled)
            - Clears recycle bin
            - Releases application reference

    Example:
        >>> with app_manager(app, gui=True) as app:

        ...     run_fault_study(app)

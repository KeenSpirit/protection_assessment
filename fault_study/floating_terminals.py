"""
Floating terminal detection and handling for fault studies.

Floating terminals are network endpoints where a line section has only
one connected terminal within the protection section. These require
special handling in fault studies because the fault must be applied
at a specific location along the line rather than at a busbar.

Functions:
    get_floating_terminals: Find all floating terminals for devices
    find_end_points: Find line sections with only one connection

    Find all floating terminal objects with their associated lines.

    Identifies terminals at the end of feeder sections that are not
    directly connected to protection device terminals. These floating
    terminals require fault current calculations at the line endpoint

"""
Protection reach factor calculations.

This module calculates reach factors for relay devices, which measure
how well a device can detect faults at remote locations in its
protection zone.

Reach Factor = (Minimum Fault Current at Location) / (Device Pickup)

A reach factor > 1.0 means the device can detect faults at that
location. Higher values indicate better protection coverage with
margin for error.

Functions:
    device_reach_factors: Calculate reach factors at multiple locations
    determine_pickup_values: Get effective pickup values for a device
    swer_transform: Transform fault current for SWER systems

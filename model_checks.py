"""
Pre-study model validation for PowerFactory protection assessment.

This module performs validation checks on protection devices before
running fault studies. It identifies common configuration issues that
would cause incorrect results or script failures.

Validation Checks:
    - Relay type assignment (typ_id must be set)
    - CT connection (cpCt must be assigned)
    - CT/relay phase count matching

Functions:
    relay_checks: Main validation entry point
    relay_type_check: Verify relay type assignment
    ct_phase_check: Verify CT configuration and phase matching

    Validate relay configuration before fault study execution.

    Performs pre-study checks on all relays to identify configuration
    issues that would affect study results. Issues are collected and
    reported as warnings in the PowerFactory output window.

    Args:
        app: PowerFactory application instance.
        relays: List of relay objects (may include other element types).

    Side Effects:
        Prints warning messages to output window if issues are found.

    Validation Checks:
        1. Relay type (typ_id) must be assigned
        2. CT (cpCt) must be connected
        3. CT phase count must match relay measurement type

    Example:

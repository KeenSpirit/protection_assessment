Feeder domain model for protection assessment.

A feeder represents a distribution circuit originating from a substation,
containing protection devices, network topology, and operating parameters.

    Represents a distribution feeder and its associated protection devices.

    The Feeder is the top-level container for protection assessment,
    holding references to all devices, network topology, and study
    results.

    Core Attributes:
        obj: The PowerFactory ElmFeeder object.
        cubicle: The feeder's source cubicle (connection point).
        term: The source terminal at the substation.
        sys_volts: System nominal voltage in kV.

    Populated During Analysis:
        devices: List of protection Device objects on this feeder.
        bu_devices: Dictionary of backup devices by grid.
        open_points: Network open points (normally open switches).

    Example:
        >>> feeder = initialise_fdr_dataclass(elm_feeder)
